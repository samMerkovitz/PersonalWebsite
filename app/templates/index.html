                    I worked at <strong>Harvard Medical School Office for External Education</strong> from July 2019 through December 2020 as a Business Development Coordinator. I worked across the office's many business units doing market research, sales outreach, and follow up to 25+ potential clients. I evaluated 40+ international schools and 90+ attendees for a symposium to determine sales opportunities. I also established a baseline for data driven market research by creating a prediction algorithm that measured how likely an institution would purchase one of our products. And finally, systematized and reported on several different Salesforce objects in order to streamline sales opportunities and data integrations as well as visualize current pipeline and revenue forecasts.
